This issues-only repository is a direct connection to the Azure Storage team. Please use issue templates to raise a:
- Bug
- Feature Request
- Question

It's okay if you aren't quite sure which one to pick. That happens sometimes. Make your best guess, and if your issue needs to be re-categorized we will do it.

Before raising an issue, consider browsing existing issues - someone may have already asked about your problem. We regularly track the recation (upvote/downvote) data - so please feel free to let us know what you think!
